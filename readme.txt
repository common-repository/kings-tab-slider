== Description ==

This plugin enables you to add multiple awesome responsive tabbed sliders in your Wordpress site. This uses custom posts.

<strong> Usage: </strong>

Here's a step by step user manual:

1. Install the plugin. (Find the instructions in the "Installation" section.) <br>
2. Find the custom post "<i>Tabs</i>" in your WordPress dashboard and click on it's submenu: Add New. You can add category as well. <br>
3. Use the shortcode to show all your tabs anywhere in your WordPress site. <pre>[tab-slider]</pre><br>
4. This plugin supports 5 styles. To change style, add shortcode attribute "style" and the value will be: <i>one, two, three, four</i> or <i>five</i>. Example: <pre>[tab-slider style="three"]</pre> or <pre>[tab-slider style="five"]</pre>
* Note: Default is <pre>[tab-slider style="one"]</pre><br>
5. If you want to add multiple tab-sliders in your site, make sure you provide unique IDs to each set of tab-sliders. Example: <pre>[tab-slider style="two" id="1"]</pre>
<pre>[tab-slider style="two" id="2"]</pre>
<pre>[tab-slider style="two" id="3"]</pre>
and thus you can add as many tab-sliders as you want. <br>
6. If you want to show different tabs (i.e. different contents) in different tab-sliders, make sure you provide unique IDs to each set of tab-sliders and set categories to them. Example: <pre>[tab-slider style="two" id="1" category="fish"]</pre>
<pre>[tab-slider style="two" id="2" category="flower"]</pre>
<pre>[tab-slider style="two" id="2" category="wordpress"]</pre>
